        <h2>Description</h2>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 medium zucchini (about 2 pounds)</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 to 4 cloves)</li>
                    <li>1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, depending on how spicy you like the pasta</li>
                    <li>2 medium tomatoes, chopped, see note (about 12 ounces)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese, plus more for serving, see notes for alternatives</li>
                    <li>1 cup basil leaves, torn into pieces</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons cold water</li>
                    <li>salt</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Trim and spiralize the zucchini (see notes below for doing this without a spiralizer). Then cut the spiralized zucchini into long noodles to be about the length of spaghetti</li>
                    <li>Add olive oil, garlic, and the red pepper flakes to a large, deep skillet. Turn to medium heat. When the oil bubbles around the garlic, add the zucchini noodles</li>
                    <li>Toss the noodles with pasta tongs and cook until al dente — they should be wilted but still have a crunch; 5 to 7 minutes. Do not let the noodles cook any longer, or else they will become mushy. As they cook, keep tossing so that all the zucchini noodles have a chance to hit the bottom of the skillet</li>
                    <li>Stir in the tomatoes, basil, and parmesan cheese, and then cook for one minute. Use pasta tongs to transfer the noodles, tomatoes, and basil to a serving dish. Leave the liquid in the skillet</li>
                    <li>Bring the liquid left in the skillet to a simmer.</li>
                    <li>Combine cornstarch and cold water in a small bowl, then whisk into the simmering liquid. Cook while whisking until the liquid thickens to a sauce; about 1 minute. Taste the sauce and season with salt</li>
                    <li>Pour the sauce over the zucchini, tomatoes, and basil. Finish with more parmesan cheese on top and serve immediately</li>
                </ol>
